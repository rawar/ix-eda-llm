# In Cube, views are used to expose slices of your data graph and act as data marts.
# You can control which measures and dimensions are exposed to BIs or data apps, 
# as well as the direction of joins between the exposed cubes.
# You can learn more about views in documentation here - https://cube.dev/docs/schema/reference/view


# The following example shows a view defined on top of orders and customers cubes. 
# Both orders and customers cubes are exposed using the "includes" parameter to 
# control which measures and dimensions are exposed.
# Prefixes can also be applied when exposing measures or dimensions. 
# In this case, the customers' city dimension is prefixed with the cube name,
# resulting in "customers_city" when querying the view.

# views:
#   - name: example_view
#
#     cubes:
#       - join_path: orders
#         includes:
#           - status
#           - created_date
#
#           - total_amount
#           - count
#      
#       - join_path: orders.customers
#         prefix: true
#         includes: 
#           - city
